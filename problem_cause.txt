The environment in the CS major is highly competitive and individualistic. This makes groups of students who value communal goals and social value or who like to work with others hard to relate and feel a sense of belonging. Moreover, most CS students are White/Asian males. It is naturally hard for other groups of students to find people from similar cultural and gender backgrounds to make connections and work together.

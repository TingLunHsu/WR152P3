CS is one of the most emerging and highest paying and demanding fields, if all the tech positions are occupied by the privileged, it widens the income and career opportunity disparities. 
Moreover, tech fields highly affect peopleâ€™s lives. For example, engineers in Facebook design the algorithms that choose what kinds of posts to promote to certain kinds of people. People tend to favor those who have similar backgrounds with or without caution. If those engineers' backgrounds are not diverse and are mainly dominated by White and Asian males, the underrepresented groups' voices might be neglected.

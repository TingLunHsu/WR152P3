Undergraduate CS programs are dominated by White and Asian male students. A National Center for Education Statistics report shows that as of 2018, only 8.9% and 10.1% of CS degrees conferred are for Black and Hispanic students. As to the female-male ratio, only around one-fourth are females. The disproportion of demographics in CS undergraduates also reflects in the job market.

Note: underrepresented students are defined as either non-White, non-Asian, or non-male in the following texts.
